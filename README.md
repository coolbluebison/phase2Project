# Financial Analysis Software for Oil & Gas Well Economics by Baran Yildiran

## Overview
This is a software prototype designed to analyze the financial and economic viability of a single oil and gas project well.
The software utilizes the Javascript and React framework to assist engineers, financial analysts or any other decision makers in the natural resources industry. It utilizes industry inputs such as Initial Production (IP) rates, decline rates and other project assumptions to generate key industry metrics such as NPV, Cumulative Cash Flows and ROI based on production data and various economics parameters. The software then tries to visualize these metrics in tables and graphs to assist in the decision making. 

## Features

- Production Type Curve Generator
- Net Present Value (NPV) Analysis
- Return on Investment (ROI) Analysis
- Monthly Revenue Projections
- Cumulative Cash Flow Analysis
- Costs Analysis
